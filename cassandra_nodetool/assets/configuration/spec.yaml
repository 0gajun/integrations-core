        description: |
          command or path to nodetool (e.g. /usr/bin/nodetool or docker exec container nodetool)
          can be overwritten on an instance
          Note: Agent v6.11+ on Windows runs as an unprivileged user (`ddagentuser`). That user needs to be granted
          access to the nodetool installation directory for the check to work.
          The nodetool installation also sets some environment variables (e.g. `CASSANDRA_HOME` and `DSCINSTALLDIR`),
          but sets them as variables only for the user doing the nodetool installation. Those environment variables should
          be set as system-wide variables.
